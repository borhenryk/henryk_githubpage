The aim of the thesis is to perform a regression on functional data. The algorithm used is  theGradient Descent algorithm. This algorithm has the following advantages: First, a large number of variables can be included in the model, potentially even more than the number of observations. Secondly, one could include different variables with a different effect in the model,in extreme cases even each variable with a different effect. Third, the algorithm also performs automatic data-based variable selection, which is a major advantage over more common meth-ods.
